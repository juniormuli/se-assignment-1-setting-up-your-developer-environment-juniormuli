# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
   Visit the Windows 11 download page (URL provided earlier).
Select "Download Windows 11" and choose the appropriate edition for your system.
Select "Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC" and click "Next."
Follow the on-screen instructions to create a bootable USB drive or DVD.
Once the installation media is created, insert it into your computer and restart.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
   Visit the Visual Studio Code download page (URL provided earlier).
Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and click "Download."
Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
When prompted, select the features and extensions you want to install.
Finally, launch Visual Studio Code from the Start menu (Windows) or Applications folder (macOS).

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
   Install Git: Visit the Git website (git-scm.com) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
Create a GitHub account: Go to the GitHub website (github.com) and create a free account.
Initialize Git repository: Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the command "git init" to initialize a Git repository.


4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
  Go to the official Python website (python.org) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Once installed, open a terminal/command prompt and type "python" to check if Python is installed correctly.
Install Python packages and modules, such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, using the "pip" command in your terminal/command prompt.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
Open a terminal/command prompt and type "python -m ensurepip". This command will install the latest version of pip.
Once pip is installed, you can install Python packages and modules using the "pip install" command in your terminal/command prompt. For example, to install NumPy, you would type "pip install numpy".
To update pip, you can use the "pip install --upgrade pip" command.

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
Visit the MySQL downloads page (URL provided earlier) and download the MySQL installer for Windows.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
When prompted, select the features you want to install. For a typical installation, select "MySQL Server" and "MySQL Workbench."
Once installed, open MySQL Workbench and click the "New Connection" button.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.
   Docker: Docker is a popular containerization tool that allows you to package your applications and their dependencies into containers. This can help ensure that your application runs consistently across different machines and environments. To use Docker, you'll need to install it on your machine and create Dockerfiles for your applications.
Virtual Machines: Virtual machines, like VirtualBox or VMware, allow you to run a virtual instance of an operating system on your machine.
Isolation: VMs can run on the same physical hardware, but they're isolated from each other, allowing for greater security and stability.
Compatibility: You can use VMs to run software on platforms it was not designed for, like running Windows applications on a macOS machine.
Versatility: VMs allow you to test different configurations and environments without affecting your primary operating system.
Ease of Management: VMs can be backed up, cloned, and easily restored to a previous state.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

ESLint: A popular linter for JavaScript and TypeScript, which helps to find potential problems in your code.
Debugger for Chrome: Allows you to debug JavaScript code running in Google Chrome.
Live Share: Enables real-time collaboration with other developers.
Git Lens: Provides detailed information about your Git repository within the editor.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

Reference: If you need to install your development environment on another machine, this document will serve as a step-by-step guide.
Documentation: Future developers who may work on your project will benefit from having a clear, detailed understanding of how your environment was set up.
Troubleshooting: Having a comprehensive record of your setup will make it easier to diagnose and fix any issues that arise.

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.
Include version numbers for all software and dependencies you installed. This can help you recreate the same environment in the future if necessary.
Add a section on common issues you encountered and how you resolved them. This will provide a quick reference if someone else experiences the same issues.
If possible, create an automatic setup script that can install all the required software and configure the development environment with a single command.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
